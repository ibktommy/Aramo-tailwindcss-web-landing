# ARAMO Landing Page Using Tailwind CSS
A website for an imaginary home-decorating company.

I developed this website to practice the CSS framework that I just learned which is "Tailwind CSS" <br>

I built this website using tailwindcss. Talwind css is a css framework that works with magorly "defined classes". <br>

Tailwind CSS is primarily mobile responsive. <br>

The website is responsive to all screen sizes - desktop and mobile.<br>

I used CSS flexbox in the project for the layuot of the website. <br>

This project has helped me to improve more on my experience using CSS. <br>

I am actually pleased with how one can also include customized classes in the tailwindcss class.

I hope to build more projects using Tailwind CSS because it is efficient and reduces the effort of making ones's project responsive.
